![](Webp.net-gifmaker.gif)

### Note : I have Created a simple calculator app using Flutter, I am not sure whether it will run or not in IOS but it is working in android devices.

So its a 3 page app.
- Splash
- Landing Page
- Operation Page.

### I am very new to Flutter just 7 days in it so there is no architecture.

What it contains if you are moving from Native App development -> Flutter App development.
- Splash Creation
- Delay in splash
- Use of button
- Use of Navigation-up
- Use of App-title
- Use of Linear Layout
- Use of Relative Layout
- Intent for Activity Switching
- Use of TextFormFields
